# Decentralized Indexing over a Network of RDF Peers
A github repository for Locational Indexes and PPBF indexes

This repository includes two directories, (i) index-source which contains the sources for the indexes, and (ii) piqnic-ext, which contains an adapted version of PIQNIC. See also our website at http://relweb.cs.aau.dk/ppbfs/ for experimental results and more details.
